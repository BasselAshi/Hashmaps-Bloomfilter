 *  Like Dynamic Arrays, we can also have Dynamic HashMaps. Working out the
 *  math would for the complexity for this structure would give you
 *  amortized expected O(1) for Add(), Find() and Delete(). Try to prove
 *  this if just computing expected and amortized costs on their own wasn't
 *  enough for you! :)

 *
 * This is the file where all of your implementation for the HashMap goes. 
 * You will be submitting this file (along with BloomFilter.c) to MarkUs.
 *
 * TestHashMap.c provides some test cases to test your implementation. 
 * You can compile it using the Makefile and running the executable produced.
